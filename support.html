    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How do I start sharing my screen?</h3>
    <p>
        1. Make sure the host and viewers are on the same Wi-Fi network or close enough for peer-to-peer to work.<br>
        2. Open BeamRoom on the host and go to the <strong>Share</strong> tab.<br>
        3. Start a room, then open Control Centre and long-press the Screen Recording button.<br>
        4. Choose <strong>BeamRoom</strong> and begin broadcasting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Viewers open BeamRoom, switch to the <strong>Watch</strong> tab, and follow the prompts to join using
        the host’s room code.
    </p>

    <h3>Does BeamRoom send my screen through your servers?</h3>
    <p>
        No. BeamRoom is designed for local, peer-to-peer sharing. Screen video and audio are sent directly
        between the host and connected viewers using the local network. We do not run servers that see your stream.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I use BeamRoom over the internet?</h3>
    <p>
        BeamRoom is meant for nearby sharing where devices are on the same Wi-Fi network or close enough
        for peer-to-peer connections. It is not a remote desktop service and is not optimised for
        long-distance internet use.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I restore Pro or other purchases?</h3>
    <p>
        If you reinstall the app or move to a new device:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Open BeamRoom.<br>
        2. Go to the Pro or upgrade screen.<br>
        3. Tap <strong>Restore Purchases</strong> and confirm with your Apple ID.
    </p>
    <p>
        As long as you are signed in with the same Apple ID that made the original purchase, Apple will restore
        your entitlement without charging again.
    </p>

    <h3>Why can’t a viewer connect?</h3>
    <p>Check the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Both host and viewer devices are running iOS&nbsp;26 or later.</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi is enabled on both devices.</li>
        <li>The viewer has entered the correct room or pairing code.</li>
        <li>Any VPNs or very restrictive firewalls are switched off or relaxed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If problems continue, try restarting BeamRoom (or the devices) and creating a fresh room.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To remove local app data and settings, delete BeamRoom from the device.</li>
        <li>If recordings were saved to Photos or Files, remove those separately in those apps.</li>
        <li>
            If you emailed us for support and would like those emails deleted, send a follow-up request and
            we will erase them where reasonably possible.
