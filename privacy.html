        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not operate servers that receive your screen stream or store it.</li>
            <li>Screen sharing happens directly between devices on the local network.</li>
            <li>Settings, pairing details and similar data are stored on your device
                (and shared locally with the BeamRoom extensions via an App Group).</li>
            <li>Purchases are processed by Apple’s App Store; we do not see your card details.</li>
            <li>Crash and diagnostics data may be shared with us by Apple if you opt in at the system level; these reports are anonymised.</li>
            <li>We do not include third-party analytics or advertising SDKs in the App.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>What the App does on your devices</h2>

        <h3>Screen capture and streaming</h3>
        <p>
            When you start a BeamRoom session as a host:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App uses Apple’s ReplayKit framework to capture the device’s screen and, if enabled, microphone audio.</li>
            <li>Captured frames are encoded into video on the device.</li>
            <li>The encoded stream is sent over the local network to viewer devices that have joined the room.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not operate servers that relay or record this stream. However, viewers can see anything that appears on
            your screen while sharing is active, and they may be able to record or capture it on their own devices.
            Only share with people you trust.
        </p>

        <h3>Networking</h3>
        <p>
            BeamRoom uses Apple’s networking frameworks (including Network.framework and related technologies) to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discover nearby devices (for example via Wi-Fi and peer-to-peer mechanisms).</li>
            <li>Exchange room information such as pairing codes and connection details.</li>
            <li>Send encoded video and audio packets between host and viewers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Connections are intended for local, nearby use. We do not run a central service that routes this traffic.
        </p>

        <h3>Local storage</h3>
        <p>The App stores information such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic settings and preferences (for example quality presets).</li>
            <li>Local pairing and room history.</li>
            <li>Purchase status, kept so that Pro features remain unlocked.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is stored on your device and, where needed, shared with the BeamRoom broadcast extension using an
            App Group. It is not transmitted to our own servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Optional recording</h3>
        <p>
            If you enable a recording feature in BeamRoom:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The host device may save a recording (such as an MP4 file) locally.</li>
            <li>Recordings are stored in the device’s storage (for example in the Files app or Photos), depending on how the feature is implemented.</li>
            <li>We do not receive copies of these recordings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can delete recordings at any time from within the relevant system app.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
        <p>Within the App we do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect your name, email address, postal address or contact list.</li>
            <li>Track your precise location.</li>
            <li>Use identifiers for advertising or cross-app tracking.</li>
            <li>Embed third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The only personal information we receive directly is what you choose to send us, for example in a support email.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>
            BeamRoom may offer in-app purchases or a Pro upgrade via StoreKit.
            Apple processes all payment transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We receive confirmation from Apple about what has been purchased (for example, which product identifier is active)
            so that the App can unlock features. We do not see full card details or your Apple ID password.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Crash reports and diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
            If you choose to share diagnostics with developers in iOS settings, Apple may provide crash logs and usage
            information linked to BeamRoom. These reports:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are managed by Apple.</li>
            <li>Do not include information that directly identifies you, such as your name or email.</li>
            <li>Help us understand crashes and performance issues so we can improve stability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can turn this sharing on or off in iOS Settings.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Email and support</h2>
        <p>
            If you contact us by email (for example at <a href="mailto:support@beamroom.app">support@beamroom.app</a>):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will receive your email address and any information you include in your message.</li>
            <li>We use this information only to reply and to improve the App where appropriate.</li>
            <li>Emails may be stored in our mail provider’s systems as part of normal email operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you later want your support emails deleted, you can ask and we will remove them where reasonably possible.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
            BeamRoom is aimed at general users and is not designed for children under 13.
            If a parent or guardian contacts us about information sent via email by a child,
            we will delete it where reasonably practical.
        </p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop sharing at any time from the broadcast controls or within the App.</li>
            <li>Turn the microphone on or off for a session via the system screen recording sheet (where available).</li>
            <li>Delete local data by removing the App from your device.</li>
            <li>Delete any saved recordings from Photos or Files if you have created them.</li>
            <li>Change privacy and diagnostics preferences in iOS Settings.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
            Email: <a href="mailto:support@beamroom.app">support@beamroom.app</a>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy as BeamRoom evolves or if legal requirements change.
            When we make significant changes, we will update the text on this page and adjust
            the effective date at the top.
